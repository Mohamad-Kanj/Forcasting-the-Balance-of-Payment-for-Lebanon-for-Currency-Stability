# Forcasting-the-Balance-of-Payment-for-Lebanon-for-Currency-Stability

**A. Description:**
Welcome to the "Forecasting Lebanon's Balance of Payment for Currency Stability" project! Our mission is to develop accurate and tailored predictive models to forecast Lebanon's Balance of Payment, contributing to the country's currency stability and economic resilience. 

**B. Scope of work**
Currency stability is essential for a thriving economy. It relies on maintaining a stable supply and demand for local and foreign currencies. By forecasting the Balance of Payment, we aim to predict the net exchange of foreign currencies and identify periods of surplus or deficiency. Consequently, the central bank can intervene appropriately, buying foreign currencies during surplus periods and selling during shortages, ensuring a stable supply and demand equilibrium for foreign currencies.


**C. Project Objective:**
The main objective of this project is to create specialized forecasting models for Lebanon's Balance of Payment. We will consider only univariate models in this project.

**D. Methodology:**
The project will employ a combination of robust forecasting techniques, including:
A. Arima model (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
B. ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal) Model
C. Building an interactive dashboard that enables users to adjust models in real time for better predictions.

**E. Limitations:**
A. Univariate Model Focus: This project's reliance on univariate predictive models may lead to limited insights as it solely considers historical economic indicators and trade data.
B. Exclusion of Socio-Political Factors: One of the significant limitations of this study is the omission of crucial socio and political factors that can substantially influence the determination of supply and demand for foreign currencies. Geopolitical events, government policies, regional conflicts, and international relations can have a profound impact on Lebanon's economic landscape, potentially affecting currency stability.
